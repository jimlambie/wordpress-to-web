Hey, You can use this page to create a static front page for your website. To do so, please select the _Hompage_ template under _Page Attributes_ on the right side within your WordPress dashboard. Then navigate to **Settings => Reading**, select _A static page_ and choose the _Home_ page as your static page from the drop-down menu. That's it - now you can go to **Appearance => Widgets** and place widgets on your front page as you like. Have fun!
